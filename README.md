OrbitMapper
===========

This program was developed by myself, Joshua Pavoncello, at Millersville University. It was made to the specifications of an Undergraduate Mathematics Research Team as a tool to aid in the research of Periodic Orbits on polygons that generate a tessellation of the plane when reflected in its edges. The Team's members, Zhigang Han Ph.D (Advisor), Ron Umble Ph.D (Advisor), Ben Baer, David Brown, Fahim Gilani, and myself required a program that would graphically simulate, for instance, a frictionless ball colliding and reflecting within the internal edges of a shape. This does exactly that, as well as implement some other tools that aid in the research.
